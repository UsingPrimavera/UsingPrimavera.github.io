title:  "Create a New Project for Primavera P6 Newbie"
description: This is my first of a series of posts for new users of the Oracle Primavera Professional client. This post covers how you create a project in P6. It is intentionally opinionated and prescriptive with the aim of getting the newbie user up and running as fast as possible. The detail and options available will be dealt with elsewhere.
