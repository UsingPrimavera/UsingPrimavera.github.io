<h2 id="about-barrie-callender">About Barrie Callender</h2>

<p>My name is Barrie Callender. I never intended to get involved in Project Management, but somehow landed a job supporting Artemis 2000 in November 1987. That was for Metier Management systems where I stayed for 13 years, followed by 5 years at Pinnacle Management Systems inc and a further 10 at what became Ten Six Consulting.</p>

<p>In June 2016 I started my own company to see what might happen. I then read Technical Blogging by Antonio Cangiano and decided to start this blog using the posts I had written for Usingp6.com. I will expand it beyond Oracle Primavera P6 to the other Oracle Primavera products.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I am married to my lovely wife Lisa and we have two teenage children. I enjoy the world of project consulting where I earn my keep. On reflection, I would probably be happiest if I could write software for a living.</p>

<p>Maybe one day I will find out.</p>
